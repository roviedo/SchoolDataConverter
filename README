Description:
	This project is a command line program that accepts student enrollment data in one format, and outputs the data in a different format.
	This project only handles CSV and XML formats, but other formats can be plugged with minimum change
	The program takes file names as arguments, and is able to go both directions with both formats.

Files:
	converter.py	                     --this file contains the main program and the CSV class for parsing the csv input and writing a csv output 
			                       and the XML class for parsing the xml input and writing a xml output.

	wgen_project__xml_schema.xsd         --this file contains the xml schema expected

	wgen_project__csv_format.txt         --this file contains the csv schema expected

	wgen_project__csv_sample_data.txt    --this file contains the sample csv data
	
	wgen_project__xml_sample_data.xml    --this file contains the sample xml data

Running Instructions:
	
	To run the program from command line we type: python followed by converter.py which is our program then the sample data file name and then 
	from what format to what format in this fashion if we want to convert from xml to csv we type "-xml2csv" or for example we want to go from
	csv to xml then we type "-csv2xml". (Note: csv filename extensions can be txt)
 
	bash-3.2$ python converter.py <name_of_sample_data_file> -<input_extension2output_extension> , then press <enter>
	e.g. bash-3.2$ python converter.py wgen_project__csv_sample_data.txt -csv2xml , then press <enter>
	
	Then you will be prompted to enter the path of output file name without the extension so you can either type the filename and it will be saved in
	the project directory.
	
	e.g.: 
	     bash-3.2$ python converter.py wgen_project__xml_sample_data.xml -xml2xml
	     Type the path of the output file without extension: xml2xml
	
	     output file in project directory is , xml2xml.xml
